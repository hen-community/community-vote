        <h2>Let's build Teia together</h2>
        <p>You are the voice of the community. Together we can build tools for on-chain voting to openly and collaboratively improve Teia. While we are working on setting up a full DAO structure, this tool will allow us to vote on important decisions with wallets used before the discontinuation of hicetnunc.xyz.</p>

      <section className="pageSection">
        <h2>Why this tool?</h2>
        <p>Because we believe that, together, we can create tools and applications respecting the community’s needs and wishes. The process of forming a real DAO will take a long time and we want to be able to vote on pressing decisions transparently and on-chain.</p>
